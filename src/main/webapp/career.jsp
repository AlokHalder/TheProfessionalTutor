                    From Health Care to Government Service, business and industry need people with a wide variety of skills to provide exceptional service to their customers or constituents. Career exploration is an essential part of preparing for adulthood, yet many teenagers and young adults have little, if any, exposure to the endless combinations of industries and occupations from which they can choose.
